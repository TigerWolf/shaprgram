<h1>Photo Data Tool</h1>

<p>We love open data, because it lets you do neat things. The problem with open data is how much effort is required to make it useful.</p>

<p>This application is aimed at government data producers who may not have the full resources of a geospatial team at their beck and call, who need to crowdsource information about their assets; and anyone that can benefit from visual imagery to supplement raw data.</p>

<h2>Use cases</h2>


<h3>Inventory</h3>
<p>Adelaide City Council produces a number of data sets regarding picnic sites, which is published on their website and as open data. Unfortunately no one was able to snap a few photos at the time, and google streetview doesn't reach these places.</p>

<p>Using this tool, anyone with a shapefile or CSV can put up a list of assets that need photographs, and download a simple .zip file with an enhanced dataset.</p>

<h3>Asset tracking</h3>
<p>Just spent a few hard earned rate payer dollars on nice new benches? Use this tool to capture a visual representation of the asset at the time of installation; and during routine tasks - letting you see how your assets survive in the wild, when they need repair or more.</p>

<h3>Much more</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Parking spaces & restricted parking - all parking inspectors carry cameras, making it trivial to document your city</li>
  <li>Signs - need to capture the signed speed limits across multiple authorities? Use this tool to complete your dataset (@@link to geelong city council efforts)</li>
  <li>Tree health - Let members of your community tell you when a tree is ill, growing too much or more - find out *before* it becomes a costly issue to rectify.</li>
</ul>
